# English-Greek-Dictionary
An English Greek Dictionary programmed in C 

<i> Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,School of Sciences,Department of Informatics</i>
<br>Project for the cource <b><i>Basic Programming Principles</b></i> for the Academic Year 2014-2015


In this project, we were asked to implement in C language a command line program that translates words from Greek into English and vice versa. The program would retain a dictionary stored in a text file, which will contain for each Greek word the corresponding English one. With the launch of the program the dictionary would be loaded into the memory and a menu of options will be given to the user:
 - <i>Insert Term</i>
 - <i>Edit Term</i>
 - <i>Delete Term</i>
 - <i>Translate Word</i>
 - <i>Translate sentence</i>
 - <i>Exit</i>
 Â <br>When the user types a word that does not exist in the dictionary instead of the program displaying an error message, it should calculate the distance of the user's word from the words of the dictionary according to Levenshtein distance and display the three closest words to the one the user typed.
 <br><br><br> The project was succesfully evaluated in February 2015 with score <b>2.5 /2.5</b>
